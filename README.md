## About Grover's Algorithm

In quantum computing, Grover's algorithm is also known as the quantum search algorithm.
It refers to a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just O(N^0.5) evaluations of the function, 
where N is the size of the function's domain. 
It was devised by Lov Grover in 1996.
Unlike other quantum algorithms, which may provide exponential speedup over their classical counterparts, Grover's algorithm provides only a quadratic speedup. 
However, even quadratic speedup is considerable when N is large and Grover's algorithm can be applied to speed up broad classes of algorithms.
**In this project we will solve a particular boolean satisfiability problem using Grover's algorithm.**
